Note that you will see an exception that the address is already in use. I have no fucking clue why this thing is evaluating the script twice, but just ignore it for now, mmkay?

== Great. Then what?

Open your browser to the following links:

 1. http://localhost:5050/
 2. http://localhost:5050/foo
 3. http://localhost:5050/other

Look inside https://github.com/danveloper/pypack/blob/master/src/main/resources/chain.py[chain.py] for the actual app code.
